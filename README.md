## What is Open Book ID?

**Open Book ID (OBID)** is an open, on-chain identification and metadata protocol for creative works. It gives every publication a portable, verifiable record that outlives platforms and borders. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## How it works (high level)

- **NFT with ownership + metadata** represents the work.  
- **Publisher (optional)** signs to add edition/format/release info.  
- **Foundation (optional)** verifies rights integrity and tombstones stolen entries.  
- **Stores/platforms** query the NFT to verify legitimacy before stocking. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Why Solana?

Open, borderless, uncensorable infrastructure suitable for global scale and low fees (Fraction of a cent). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
